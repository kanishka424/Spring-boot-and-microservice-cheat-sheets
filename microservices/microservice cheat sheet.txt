=============Spring Boot Microservices Level 1: Communication and Discovery=========================

Monolithic
it can be multiple code bases but what gets deployed ,can have multipel codebase
is one entity
it runs on one server
it is scales as a single entity

So some Monolithics can be same as Microservices
BUT WHAT HAPPENS AT RUN TIME IS VERY DIFFERENT

it effect 
        how you think about your code
        what are the other things happen around your code


HERE WE WILL HAVE MICROSERVICS TALK TO EACH OTHER   

Cohesion-In computer programming- cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.
 In one sense, it is a measure of the strength of relationship between the methods and data of a class and some unifying purpose or concept served by that class.


 Cohesion and Coupling-Coupling shows the relationships between modules. Cohesion shows the relationship within the module. Coupling shows the relative independence between the modules. 
 Cohesion shows the module's relative functional strength. While creating, you should aim for low coupling, i.e., dependency among modules should be less.


 SW with High cohesion has low coupling which is good-(Coupling and Cohesion in Software Engineering Tutorial | Cohesion and Coupling with Examples(youtube )
)




SPring cloud is ONE techonolgy you can do microservices


2.Why so many technologies(2nd video)

Software modularity is the decomposition of a program into smaller programs 
with standardized interfaces

Because of modularity
we have address issues like
                we have to make sure our release process is fine
                we have make microservices scalable you can have multiple copies


**Scalibility-Software scalability is an attribute of a tool or a system 
                to increase its capacity and functionalities based on its users' demand.


Advantage IN Microservices
when we try to solve something in Monolithic system 
e.g-how to call shopping cart service from Cateog service ,the problem is very Specific
we are gone to have to sove this for our monolithics
BUT when we break down to micro services thhese problems become generics
e.g-Load balnacing is a generic problem
when you break down to MS the individual service is doing what your application 
is suppose to do but between MS thats a common probclem
wheteher you need  to call shopping cart 
built FB

if it s a common problem there are Frameworks for it
there are technologies to solve those problems


Reagrdless of the aplication you can apply these solutions


SOLUTIONS-load balncing,Eureka


reference-MonovsMicro image



3.Microservices vs service oriented architectures(video 3)

Service discovery is a pattern
which makes microservices work well together



microservices and web services(SOA Service Oriented Architecture)

when you are building a service to SOA you build the service for Reusability
but you dont know where it will be used


e.g-wheter or IPL web service

when creating a SOA what they have in mind is a utility not an application
"I dont know where it will be used and who ever wants to use it can use it"




Microservices

when you build  a service in microservices you kow that you service will be used in this particular
application (e.g-for an e-commerce app)
e.g-you break down e-commerce application to multiple services and knowing  very well that this MS willmight only
be used in that application and You are OKAY with it!!
it can or can not be used to external apps but its okay
its not a requirment

SOA is standerdize something might brak in futher
but MS only used for that app
  UI can alos be MS which consumes other MS 


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

  4. The application we'll be building

  we will use spring cloud


  we will have  3 MICROSERVICS and two of them will call the 3rd MS
  and 3rd one would consolidate those data from 1st and 2nd and will retrun a reponse to you

refernce -intital app architecture


UI will be-the movie description and ID



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

05 Designing the sample microservices 

1.Movie catalog Service
    input:user ID
    output:Movie list with details
2.Movie Info Service
     input:Movie ID
    output:Movie Details
3.Rating data Service
     input:user ID
    output:Movie list with details


    refernce-MS architecture with input and output


    Each service is a seperate MS project


    MS is when services form a bigger than themself thing


    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4


    6th video

    just creat thee services







    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


    07 Building the Movie Catalog Service API


    @SpringBootApplication-the main class,tell this is a spring boot app

when runnning Tomcat server runs




*@RestController-let know its a rest controler
**RequestMapping("/catalog")//matches URL to class
//after @RestController


@RequestMapping("/{userId}")//matches URL to method
//here {userId } is varible we pass


@PathVarible- to pass varible we get from @RequestMapping to method 


e.g-
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/catalog")
public class MovieCatalgItem{

@RequestMapping("/{userId}")
public List<CatalogItem> getCatalog(@PathVarible("userId")String userId){
  return Collection.singeltonList(
    new CatalogItem("transformers")
  )

}

}





$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

08 Building the Movie Info Service API

you can use different technologies to different MS as long as theey use REST




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

09 Configuring server port for microservices 


in production icroservices will run ondifferent servers so we wont face this

in application.properties

server.port=8081


in production you will run the jar file



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

10.Coding the third service and discussing communication



HOW TO MAKE REST CALL FROM YOUR CODE?

calling REST API programitically

using REST client library
deprecated wit web client(reactive programming,asynchronous )

RestTemplate-a client already in our path

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

11 Using RestTemplate to call an external microservice API


RestTemplate -the utility that lets us make the call

RestTemplate restTemplate=new RestTemplate();
//**Resttempalte has methods on it
RestTemplate.getObject();
//1st argument -URL
//it returns a  String and it knows how to unmarshall it
//if you know the payload you can create a class with same properties as the JSOn and RestTemplate can poupulate 
//values to it and give

//in different MS you can create the same model again to be independent of other MS



restTemplate.getForObject("URL",movie.class)//movie.class is what it returns


****When you have java to unmarshall something from another 
    YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE AN EMPTY CONSTRUCTOR


    e.g-in Movie class


    public Movie(){

    }
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


12 Using a Bean to create RestTemplate instance

//hardcoding URL in RestTemplate is bad


in MovieCatelogResource class's getCatelog() we create RestTemplate
and when the method is done it is no more,every time we call the method
we create a  RestTemplate for a fraction of second
@RequestMapping("/{userId}")
public List<CatalogItem> getCatalog(@PathVarible("userId")String userId){
RestTemplate restTemplate=new RestTemplate();

//so now we need to make it  creaet create one insstance of RestTemplate and use it for multiple MovieCatelogResource
//how to make any object and shared across multiple classes ??YOU COULD MAKE A Bean
//Beans are singelton by default


so in @SpringBootApplication class (because it runs only once)
//***IMPORTANT
@SpringBootApplication
public class RestTemplate getRestTemplate{
@Bean
public RestTemplate getRestTemplate(){
    retrun new RestTemplate();
}



Now we have to autowire the Resttemplate bean where ever we want to use it

in MovieCatelogResource.java 


@Autowired
private RestTemplate Resttempalte;



A calss is a spring bean it self


if we have bean of same type you get an error

@Bean - PRODUCER
@Autowire -CONSUMER



RestTemplate is synchronised and blocking but 
WebClient is asynchronous


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

13 Using WebClient to make API calls




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SKIPPED FOR NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



***Dont return a list from api just return an object property assigned




$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

15.Why you should avoid returning lists in APIs 


no one care if you add another property your json


but if you cahnge a list to an object code will break in futher if you decide to cnvert it to an object


search about parameterized types


Here we are breaking our Rule byreturning a list


reference -MS code 1 refer the code for better understanding



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


16 Audience questions on microservice communication 


to use asynchronuse programming do use WebClient instead of Resttempalte and also dont use block()with webClient



All RestTemplate care about is remote api returning a JSON it does not care if its implemented
on Spring,etc.....



we can handle security by
1.using Https
2.Using authentication(there are different levels of authentication in this)



REFERNCE-MS code 1 (must refer so important)



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
17 Understanding Service Discovery


What we do wrong

        1.Hardcoding the url

why hard coding bad
        1.Load balancing
      2.dynamic unmarshall3.multiple environments



      Because of this WE have SERVICE DISCOVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!
 IMPORTANT****************listen to what is service discovery otherwise  it will be verbose

We provide a level of abstraction

refrence-Service discovery 1


Discovery server know where the services are

1.CLIENT SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY (TIME 4.50)

CLIENT ASKS the "Discovery Server" and discover server tells client where the 
particular service is then client will call the service



2.SERVER SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY
client->Discovery server->service

REFERENCE-server side service discovery



Two service discovery
1.CLIENT SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY
2.SERVER SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY


***************Spring cloud use client side discovery

This all happens BTS with spring cloud

with spring cloud you just need to put do some configurations and it will work



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

18 Introducing Eureka



we talked about pattern(service discovery) and now the technology -Eureka
(Eureka for finding)


Netflix OSS
Eureka is made thanks to Netflix
Netflix one of the leaders Micro service libraries that made open source 
Netflix libraries work well with Spring boot

e.g-
Eureka
Ribbon
Hysterix
Zuul
and lot more


Spring build an abstraction that works well with libraries


just like JPA abstraction we can use Hibernate or anyother technology

yoy talk to spring boot spring boot talks to right technology



we will use spring cloud and Eureka to discover service


Eureka Client cando
1.Tell Eureka server "hey! im here"(Client)
2.Tell Eureka Server "I need this service "(Service)

Steps to make it work

1.Start up Eureka server

2.Have microservice register (publish) using
Eureka client

3.Have microservices locate(consume) using Eureka client
 





 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

 19 Starting a Eureka server

To create a Eureka server you download a spring boot application
we named it discovery-server)
***What makes it a Eureka server is "Eureka server" library

**there is another "Eureka Discovery" which is fo5r client

in main aftre @SpringBootApplication use @EnableEurekaServer

***we need add jaxb also otherwise we get errors


when you start server you will see the Eureka UI
there is a phone book

We have to set the client only then services can tell they  are there

reference-Eureka Server


when staring Eureak server you will get bunch of errors to get rid of those 
add propeties to application.properties
To Eureak server to not to regeister it self
Every Eureka server is an Eureak Client
Not only multple instance of MS but multiple instances of Eureak servers we can have
AND they can register with each Other also (eureak server) 
so even if one service fails other service would work
 there is a propety I can say to Eureks server to stop acting like a client


 eureka.client.register-with-eureka=functionalities
 eureka.client.fetch-registry=false


we add those to stop howing errors if you dont its also fine it will still work



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


20 Creating Eureka clients


Add the "Eureka Client" dependency to have  the 3 microservices register with Eureka

spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client


also add spring-cloud version

why??by doing this other dependencies in spring cloud like eureka client,eureka server,et..
we dont have to specify each ones version
this would only affect spring cloud dependencies


THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SPRING CLOUD
add Eureka client


add @EnableEurekaClient


Spring cloud is the technology we use which is wrapped around by
spring wrappers
thats why we download those seperately



TIP-Copy the pom xml from git and paste in code

Now from server UI you can see a service named "UNKNOWN " is registered to server
But we just added client depndency to services????

Its "UNKNOWN" because we didnt set service name ,so in "MovieInfoService" application
in application.properties set
spring.application.name=movie-info-service



Now in Eureak Server we can see "movie-info-service" instead of "UNKNOWN"



HOW DID CLIENT FOUND EUREKA SERVER??HOW DID IT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR??

ANSWER-BECAuSE WE HAVE USED THE DEFAULT PORT,I OTHERWISE WE NEED TO LET IT KNOW
THE PORT BY ADDING to application.propeties

then add other client services as well to Eureka server
****add @EnableEurekaClient
name them in application.properties



reference -Eureka server with 3 Services






$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4
21 Discovering services through Eureka
 

 Now we have registered services now we need to know how to CONSUME those  in our services


"Hey Eureka Service give me this servicce"


In our example Service Consuming happens in Movie-catalog-service


The way to consumeservices involves another annotation

library provides abstration the same way server side discovery proviide


so use the annotation @LoadBalanced
this is used with RestTemplate bean

@Bean
@LoadBalanced
public RestTemplate getRestTemplate(){
  return new RestTemplate()
}


@LoadBalanced- its say to RestTemplate the URL im giving is basically a hint to discover service 
              not the actual service + bunch of other things

              Now just by doing this RestTemplate will look for hints on what URLs to look for

              rather than say "http://localhost:8082/movies/"

              we have to give the names the Eureka server has given those

              e.g-"http://rating-data-service/movies/"

time 1.25 -listen


library provids abstraction

Now when we start this RestTemplate wiil take "rating-data-service" as a service name 
calls Eureks server determine actual port and host and then the subsequent calls
All this abstraction is hidden in library and makes it look like we are making a simple call

***When we deploy it to production or QA still works fine(must have Eureka server there also)

reference-MS CODE 2 WITH EUREKA





$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$



so after Eureak client gets service information by calliing Eureka server
**there is a defult cache in Eurek client (read)


the @LoadBalanced is because not only service discovery it does Load balancing also

we can have multiple  instance of same servicebut what service get called is handle by @LoadBalanced
it is handle by load balncing


refernce-load balancing

time 2.22 listen HOw to make multiple instances run


refernce-multiple instance running


but not effective load balancing(Not sure)
()
















@LoadBalanced-load balancing+ service discovery
