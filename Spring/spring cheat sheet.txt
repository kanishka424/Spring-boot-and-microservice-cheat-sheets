spring tutorial -understanding the bean factory(3 video)

Whole dependecy injection is possible because spring is  a CONTAINER
OF BEANS/FACTORY OF BEANS


CONTAINER-
e.g- Tom cat container 
    tom cat creats the servlet objects which requires to run 
    an application
    we proide an xml and it reads xml


if you create object using "new" it wont be handle by spring


SPRING USES "FACTORY PATTERN" TO CREATE BEANS

we create DrawingApp.js(main class)
we create Triangle.java class

then at outside we create spring.xml-where xml configuration provides



in DrawingApp.js
BeanFactory factory=new XmlBeanFactory(new FileSystemResource("spring.xml"))
Triangle triangle=("Triangle")factory.getBean("triange")//getBean() is the method to ask for an object,we should cast to Triangle beacuse getBean() returns an objectp]l

triangle.draw()
